            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHen his Excellency marched from <hi>Dublin</hi> towards <hi>Mun≈øter,</hi> he left me intru≈øted with that Garri≈øon, my ≈øelfe, and tho≈øe left with me at that time being ≈øicke: The fir≈øt party that recovered were ≈øent after the Army; to wit, about 800 Foot, and 200 Hor≈øe, which fought and beat the Enemy upon their march: Some more of tho≈øe ≈øicke men that were left recovering, and ≈øome recruits comming over. After I had ≈øurpri≈øed the ≈øtrong Fort upon the Bog of <hi>Allin,</hi> and taken <hi>Ca≈øtle-Martin</hi> in the County of <hi>Kildare,</hi> and placed a Garri≈øon therein. About the latter end of December, marched with a party of 1000 Hor≈øe and Foot into the I≈øland of <hi>Allin,</hi> and ≈øummoned <hi>Killmaog</hi> therein, but finding it not feazable to ≈øtorme without Guns, I marched to <hi>Rabride</hi> and <hi>Pon≈øers Grange,</hi> and tooke them, and placed two ≈øtrong Garri≈øons there, which did give me good footing in the County of <hi>Kildare,</hi> then ≈øent a party and took <hi>Kildare, Hertwell,</hi> and <hi>Cotling≈øtowne,</hi> three u≈øefull Garri≈øons in the ≈øaid County; and provi≈øions being ≈øpent returned back to <hi>Dublin,</hi> there endeavouring to get Guns, Mortar peeces, and other nece≈ø≈øaries ready to draw forth againe with all po≈ø≈øible ≈øpeed; in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim I received Propo≈øitions from the Governour and Officers in the ≈øtrong Garri≈øon and Fort of <hi>Balli≈øonan,</hi> the originall whereof, I here inclo≈øed pre≈øent you with all under their owne hands, which being by me utterly rejected.</p>
            <p>I marched upon Tue≈øday the 26 of Feb. with a party of 2000 Foot, and 1000 Hor≈øe, towards the County of <hi>Kildare,</hi> and took with me one Culverin, and one Demi-culverin, and one Mortar-piece, the Enemy fired their Garri≈øons of Fort of Lea≈øe, Blackreath, &amp; the forementioned Ca≈øtle of Kilmaog in the I≈øland of Allin; but I ≈øhall ea≈øily make it te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable againe, it being very u≈øefull for your ≈øervice, they al≈øo did blow up the Ca≈øtle of Athy, where they had a ≈øtrong Garri≈øon, and broke up the Bridge. Upon the 28 Feb. I marched from the Naas, and about four a clock with the Van of the party, I came to Belli≈øonan a ≈øtrong Garri≈øon, double Works, and double moted, full of water one within another, and amount with a Fort upon it, mo≈øt of the Officers with me e≈øteeming the taking of it to be unfeazable, it being late, and I unwilling to lo≈øe time, did ≈øend in a Summons, a copy whereof is here inclo≈øed, &amp; the inclo≈øed an≈øwer under the Governours hand was pre≈øently returned, &amp; the Town which was without his Works by him burned that night, I cau≈øed a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery to be made and planted the Artillery, and made a Fort for the ≈øecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity therof, having intelligence that the Lord of Ca≈øtlehaven, with 4000

            <p>The tenth in≈øtant, Letters from Sir <hi>Charles Coote</hi> (then at Belfa≈øt) brought the newes of reducing Ca≈øtle Dooe.</p>
